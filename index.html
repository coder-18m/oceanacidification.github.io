        <h3>What is Ocean Acidification?</h3></div>
      <div class="flex-item" id="what-is-p"> <p>Ocean Acidification is the acidity of the oceans rising (lower pH) due to the absorption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This is because when carbon dioxide reacts with water it releases Hydronium (H3O+) ions, which are acidic, into the water. These molecules fight for calcium carbonate (CaCO3) against small organisms, such as Oysters, shellfish and others. In turn, because the organisms have to spend so much energy for carbonate they are weaker and have a tougher time surviving. Inevitably, this puts the overall food chain at risk, as smaller organisms die off, the larger organisms will have a tougher time finding food and will subside in survial.</p> </div>

        <h3>Negitive Impacts</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="flex-item" id="negitive-impacts-p"> <p>Negitive impacts of Ocean Acidification are detrimental to the world and the functionality of life. First of all, small animals like clams, oysters, sea urchins, shellfish, and larger organisms that feed off of smaller,will have a hard time surviving. This is because the small organisms need carbonate to build their shells, and they're having to spend more engery to do so because of the H3O+ ions bonding with the carbonate and leaving a more scarce amount. Thus, the small organisms are left weaker. Another negative impact: ecosystem services. These are services that rely on the ecosystem to function. Such as, commercial fisheries, shell fisheries, aquaculture recreational fisheries, subsistence and traditional shellfisheries and Tourism activities, such as snorkeling and scuba diving. It should also be noted, the U.S. oysters, clams and scallops supply seafood is valued around 400 million. While ocean acidification causes environmental dilemmas, it will also cause economical, with loss of jobs and food.</p> </div>

      <h3>Misconceptions</h3>
    </div>

  <!-- flex container 2-->
  <div class="flex-container">
    <div class="flex-item" id="miscon-p"> <p>Next, let's clear up some common misconceptions about Ocean Acidification. First, "Ocean Acidification won't affect humans or cause problems to us." This actually not true. Because ocean acidification does harm to the food chain, people that depend on fish would have less resources of food. Also, from an economic viewpoint, there are many industries that are dependent on small organism that need carbonate to survive. Another misconception is around the coral reef, "because organisms like corals have been around for hundreds of millions of years, over which time the atmospheric carbon dioxide has varied a lot, we don't need to be concerned about ocean acidification." Having a long evolutionary histroy really doesn't give much information on whether marine calcifiers were rare or not. However, if corals become rarer then their ability to maintain the coral reefs will diminish.</p>
